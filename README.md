# SquareMan

This is SquareMan - a side-scrolling survival game where you play as the titular block. Avoid the incoming obstacles and stay alive as long as you can! Your health
will drop the more you run into obstacles, and SquareMan will get more and more upset when you do. Also, he'll die when his health is all gone. But not to worry! If you collect the incoming pellet (the little 
red and white block screaming towards you) some of your health will be restored!
